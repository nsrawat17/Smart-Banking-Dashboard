📊 Smart Banking Insights: Growth, Risk & Customer Analytics
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Banking Analytics Dashboard designed to analyze loan growth, customer behavior, and credit risk.
The goal is to provide a single-screen, data-driven view that helps stakeholders understand portfolio health, identify high-risk segments, and uncover growth opportunities.

The dashboard focuses on key banking metrics such as loan performance, NPA trends, customer demographics, and loan purpose analysis, enabling informed and proactive decision-making.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze overall loan portfolio performance

Identify high-risk customer segments using NPA analysis

Understand customer distribution by age and income

Evaluate risk vs growth across different loan purposes

Support data-driven lending and credit monitoring decisions

📈 Key KPIs

Total Loan Amount: 744M

Total Loan Accounts: 78K

NPA Ratio: 22.05%

Average Credit Score: 632.61

These KPIs provide a quick snapshot of portfolio size, risk exposure, and borrower credit quality.

📊 Dashboard Analysis & Insights
1️⃣ Risk Analysis by Income Group

NPA ratio is significantly higher in lower-income segments

Higher-income customers show more stable repayment behavior

Highlights the need for stricter credit checks in lower-income slabs

2️⃣ Customer Demographics (Age Group)

Majority of customers fall in the 25–39 age group

Indicates strong growth potential

Also requires careful risk monitoring due to high exposure

3️⃣ Loan Portfolio Distribution

Education, Medical, and Personal loans contribute the highest loan amounts

These categories act as major growth drivers

However, some high-volume loan types also show elevated risk

4️⃣ NPA by Loan Purpose

Debt Consolidation, Medical, and Home-related loans show higher NPA percentages

Demonstrates that high disbursement ≠ low risk

Emphasizes the importance of evaluating growth and risk together

5️⃣ Portfolio Health

Around 22% of loans are non-performing

Reinforces the need for proactive credit risk management

Helps management focus on early risk detection

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI – Dashboard development & visualization

DAX – KPI calculations and measures

Advanced Excel – Data cleaning, transformation, and validation

Power Query – Data preparation and modeling

📂 Dataset Description

Customer demographic data (age, income group)

Loan details (loan amount, loan purpose)

Credit-related metrics (credit score, loan status)

Risk indicators (NPA classification)

(Dataset used for academic and analytical purposes)

💡 Key Takeaways

Lower-income segments carry higher default risk

Young customers (25–39) drive growth but need monitoring
